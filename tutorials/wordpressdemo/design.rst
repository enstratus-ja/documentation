Design Deployment
-----------------

Now that those steps are complete, it's time to start building the application
architecture. 

First, create a new deployment by navigating to Automation > Designer. If you have not yet
created a deployment, a placeholder image greets you:

.. figure:: ./images/deployment0.png
   :height: 800px
   :width: 1500 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Deployment Designer
   :align: center

   Deployment Designer

To create a new deployment, select the actions menu and choose Create a New Deployment.

.. figure:: ./images/deployment1.png
   :height: 800px
   :width: 1500 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Deployment Designer, Create New Deployment
   :align: center

   Deployment Designer, Create New Deployment

And that's it, the deployment is created.

.. figure:: ./images/deployment2.png
   :height: 800px
   :width: 1500 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Deployment Designer, Create Tier
   :align: center

   Deployment Designer, Deployment Created
