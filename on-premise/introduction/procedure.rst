Our goal is, at the end of this process, to provide the operations team a
fully-functional and tested installation of the enStratus software. The times above are
optimal estimates that should be used as guidelines only. Each installation is unique and
comes with its own challenges, and enStratus engineers are ready to help make each
project a success.

 
If you choose to have an enStratus engineer visit your datacenter to help you
successfully complete your installation, some measure of familiarization and training is
a strong factor in making the project a success.

 
To prepare for your engagment with enStratus and the installation of the cloud
management software, we have prepared some worksheets at the end of this section that will
provide enStratus engineers with the information they need to configure enStratus for your
environment.
