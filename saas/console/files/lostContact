enStratus has lost the ability to ping i-ex7d28c5 in N. Virginia (us-east-1)
(available).

You will receive this alert if enStratus had previously successfully pinged the
server, but is no longer able to ping it. enStratus makes sure that ICMP packets
can traverse the network elements it controls, but you should verify that you
have not put in place anything that would prevent enStratus from pinging your
server.
