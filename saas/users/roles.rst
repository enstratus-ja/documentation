How roles affect users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We've been saying that a user 'inherit' access rights from the role assigned
to the group(s) they are assigned. Roles have very granular access control definitions
which are useful when defining the type and level of access users in a group should have.
The enforcement of access controls is done through the enStratus console. A user may see a
limited set of options when clicking on the actions link for a cloud resource.

In the SaaS version of enStratus this is the method by which enStratus enforces access
controls.

In an on-premise deployment, customers may choose the option to completely hide cloud
resources to which a user has no access. Again, this enforcement is done through the
enStratus console, except in this case if a user has no access to a cloud resource, the
resource is not presented to the user.
