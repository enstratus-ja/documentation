Notification Topics
-------------------

enStratus supports management of cloud based notification topic web services through the
enStratus console. Notification topics are often applied to an application and can be used
to automatically send messages to subscribers or other applications.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

enStratus currently supports the creation and management of Amazon Simple Notification
Service (Amazon SNS). See Amazon SNS for more information and current pricing.

Notification topics makes it easy for the developer to send out important messages to
applications or users. This allows for the developer to effectively communicate
time-sensitive information in the form of a message.
