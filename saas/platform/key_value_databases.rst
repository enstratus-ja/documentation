Key Value Databases
-------------------

enStratus Key/Value Databases (KV Databases or KVDB) are a simple solution for storing
your data for high availability and scalability. With a KV database you get only what you
need. You can simply query your data and return the results without having to manage
different schemas for your stored data sets. You do not need to worry when storing new
data because it is automatically indexed for you.

Overview
~~~~~~~~
enStratus currently supports the creation and termination of Amazon SimpleDB domains. See
Amazon SimpleDB for more information and current pricing.

KV databases are large collections of data organized into separate domains. The data is
stored in hash tables that contain key to value pairs. The key to value pairs are
attributes that can be searched in lexicographical queries.
