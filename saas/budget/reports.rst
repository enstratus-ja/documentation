Using the reports tab, information relating to billing and charges can be sorted by
billing code, resource, user, and group. Use the drop down box selector for Show Usage By:
to choose the preferred method for displaying data.

Use the date selector drop down options to look back to previous months usage. 


Billing Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Displaying usage by billing code will display the costs associated with each billing code
for which there is information. This view is similar to the information presented when
viewing

Infrastructure > Budget Codes. In this view, however, costs are segregated into two main
categories. First, the costs for usage based on the price charged by the cloud provider.
Second, the costs charged by enStratus. 


Resource
~~~~~~~~

To view charges associated with cloud resources such as servers and load balancers, select
Show Usage By: Resource from the option list and click Get Report.
