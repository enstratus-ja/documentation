.. _agent_overview:

Overview
--------
The enStratus agent is composed of a lightweight tomcat application used for communicating
with the enStratus provisioning server and a set of associated shell scripts. The shell
scripts are responsible for executing some actions on the server and are extensible by end
users.

The agent listens on port 2003 and takes action based on user input as in the case of
adding a user to a system (the addUser script) and also automates actions such as
attaching, formatting, encrypting, and mounting volumes as part of a fully automated
enStratus deployment. Communication to and from the enStratus provisioning server is
encrypted using SSL.

The enStratus agent is suitable for use on many popular GNU/Linux distributions such as
Ubuntu, Debian, Cent OS, and Fedora. Additionally, the enStratus agent works on Windows
Server 2003/2008. The agent functions in both 32- and 64-bit environments.

The enStratus agent and the associated scripts can be found in /enstratus on a GNU/Linux
system, and in C:\enstratus on a Windows server.

Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Installing the enStratus agent opens the server to the full functionality provided by
enStratus including user management, automation, scheduled termination, statistics,
logging, and alerting.

enStratus will monitor servers that have the agent installed and alert when status changes
occur as in the case of an unexpected termination of the server. In an automated
deployment, enStratus will take the further step of restoring lost servers.
