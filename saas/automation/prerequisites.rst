#. The most important pre-requisite for automation is the installation of the enStratus
   agent. The enStratus agent is the secure access point to each running instance for the
   enStratus cloud management software.

.. note:: This pre-requisite is one of the most frequently asked questions about
  automation. Before a machine image can be used in a deployment launch configuration, 
  the enStratus agent must be installed.

  For more information on how to install the agent, please see the agent documentation.
