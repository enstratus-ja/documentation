   prerequisites

enStratus automation encompasses many facets of infrastructure management and orchestration.

#. **Automated backups**: enStratus will perform backup/maintenance of the application and
   hardware infrastructure according to the specification of the deployment. Backups
   include both snapshots and service-level backups.
#. **Scalability**: enStratus will scale the servers to closely match infrastructure with
   demand.
#. **Resiliency**: Cloud servers by their nature are ephemeral, configuring a deployment will
   allow applications to survive the unexpected termination of a node.
