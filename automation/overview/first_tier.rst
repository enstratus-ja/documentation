Add First Tier
--------------

An enStratus tier is a component that can have services (software) tied to it. The tier
layer is where attributes such as minimum/maximum servers and scaling rules are set.

In assembling the deployment, the first thing to do after creating the new deployment is
to add tiers.

   :width: 600 px
   :scale: 75 %
   :alt: Tier Added
   :align: center

   Tier Added

Adding the first tier prompts enStratus to create a placeholder for a launch
configuration.
